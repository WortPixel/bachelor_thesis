# Bachelor Thesis "PaDIF - A Particle Detector Interaction Framework for cosmic rays"

Within the scope of this bachelor thesis a new framework for simulations of particle-detector-interactions and based upon that two programs emulating first measurement processes are created. While the framework enables users to build various kinds of interaction settings including custom detectors, the developed programs focus on measuring cosmic particles in ice.

## Required programs (and versions that work for me):  
* GNU Make 3.81  
* cmake 2.8.10.2  
* CINT/ROOT C/C++ Interpreter 5.18.00  
* TeXLive 2013  

## Used libraries:  
* boost 1.53.0  
* ROOT 5.34/07
